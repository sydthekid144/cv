        <em>
          <p>Former Philosophical Student Turned Computer Progammer <strong>In Training </strong></p>
        </em>
        <p>This will be the begining of my story where I make a drastic turn in
          my leaning from being a philosophy major and applying to law schools to realizing
          it wasn't for me and deciding to teach myself coding to pave a new furtur for myself. So i've decided
          to invest in my future and take a 100 day bootcamp where i diligently learn coding in an effort
          to one day work for a company and be able to support myself without putting myself futher into dept.
          I've realized way too late that my generation has trailblazed the idea that you can create your own
          path without having to go to college and authough i'm greatful for my degree and am thankful to have
          come to this integral realization that ma have saved my life</p>
